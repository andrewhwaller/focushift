## Introduction

FOCUSHIFT is an Omnifocus-inspired task and project management application. Users can create Tasks, assign those tasks to Projects, and create Parterships with other uses that allow them to collaborate on getting things done. Users can also organize their tasks and projects based on different locations or situations that they work in by using the Contexts feature.

## Getting Started with FOCUSHIFT

First, head over to the app's Heroku deployment at https://glacial-plateau-67081.herokuapp.com. If this is your first time using Focushift, click the "Sign Up" link to create an account using your email address. Alternatively, you can use the "Sign in with Facebook" link to create an account using your Facebook credentials. A link to Focushift's privacy policy is available at the bottom of the sign in screen.

Once you're logged in you'll be greeted by the Inbox view. This is the heart of the Getting Things Done workflow. Use the Inbox to jot down the things that you need to get done. Use the text box at the top of the Inbox to quickly create new tasks. You can also check off tasks as you complete them.

Aside from tasks, you can organize your to-dos via Projects, Contexts, and Partnerships. Projects are groups of tasks that belong together. Contexts are locations or conceptual groupings that you might want to keep track of, i.e., Work, Home, School, etc. Finally, partnerships are connections that you can create with other users to share projects and tasks. 

When you're finished using Focushift, use the menu at the top right of the screen to logout.

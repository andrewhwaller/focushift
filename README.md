## Introduction

FOCUSHIFT is an Omnifocus-inspired task and project management application. Users can create Tasks, assign those tasks to Projects, and create Parterships with other uses that allow them to collaborate on getting things done. Users can also organize their tasks and projects based on different locations or situations that they work in by using the Contexts feature.
